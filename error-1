Error: Terraform does not have the necessary permissions to register Resource Providers.
│ Terraform automatically attempts to register the Azure Resource Providers it supports, to
│ ensure it is able to provision resources.
│ If you don't have permission to register Resource Providers you may wish to disable this
│ functionality by adding the following to the Provider block:
│ 
│ provider "azurerm" {
│   resource_provider_registrations = "none"
│ }
│ 
│ Please note that if you opt out of Resource Provider Registration and Terraform tries
│ to provision a resource from a Resource Provider which is unregistered, then the errors
│ may appear misleading - for example:
│
│ > API version 2019-XX-XX was not found for Microsoft.Foo
│
│ Could suggest that the Resource Provider "Microsoft.Foo" requires registration, but
│ this could also indicate that this Azure Region doesn't support this API version.
│
│ More information on the "resource_provider_registrations" property can be found here:
│ https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#resource-provider-registrations
